# Sales-Analysis-SQL-Assignment-
Assignment Overview:
This Assignment demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of sales data using SQL queries in MySQL. The goal of the project is to perform data analysis and extract valuable insights from sales transactions.
Iâ€™ve applied SQL window functions, aggregation, ranking, and filtering techniques to solve intermediate and advanced-level analytical questions that reflect real-world business scenarios.

Key Objectives:
Calculate total sales, rank products, and analyze top-performing products.
Perform advanced analysis using window functions to compute running totals, sales differences, and top records.
Extract meaningful insights that aid in decision-making, such as identifying top sales in specific time periods.

Key SQL Techniques:
Window Functions:
Cumulative total sales per product.
Ranking products based on total sales.
Calculating sales differences between consecutive purchases for each customer.

Aggregation:
Grouping data by customer_id, product_id, and sale_date to calculate total sales and quantities.

Filtering and Sorting:
Retrieving top sales records for specific months.
Filtering data based on dates and conditions like the year and month.
